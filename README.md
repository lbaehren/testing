testing
=======

Small collection of source code used for testing out coding ideas


There always is some area where small pieces of code get written for simply testing out stuff - be it working with a 3rd party library or new module. Hence code is being generated which otherwise fits in hardly anywhere else (at least not in a proper way). In order however not to repeat oneself and being able to revise earlier experiments, everything is put under version control for tracking and access across sites.
